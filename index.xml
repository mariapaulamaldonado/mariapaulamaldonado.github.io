      <title>Elements of Coexistence</title>

      <description>Facing climate change, environmental destruction, and extinctions as well as individualistic mindsets, inequalities, binary thinking and Eco-anxiety, the project Elements of Coexistence aims to reflect poetically on our shared existence on planet Earth through our shared global commons, such as water, soil, seeds, air, and sunlight.
The project addresses environmental issues by questioning how to dwell in our fragile historical moment while sharing diverse perspectives and points of view.
The first stage of &amp;ldquo;Elements of Coexistence&amp;rdquo;, a project in collaboration with Elham Asadpour, took the shape of an exhibition with the same title at Make-up, in Berlin, Germany, from the 29th of September until the 3rd of October 2022.</description>

Solo exhibition, 11m3, Weimar, Germany.
Navigating through contours is a project that reflects on how to navigate through the known and the unknown, through that which is near and that which is far. With the help of marks, maps, frames and grids, that create the contours of our own paths and limits of positioning, repositioning, steering and keep going. The project ponders on the representation of places, objects, situations and concepts that we grasp to in order to try to understand them and be able to relate to them.</description>

      <title>The Bird Choir - Mimicking Is Surviving</title>
      <link>https://mariapaulamaldonado.github.io/blog/9-birdchoir/</link>

      <description>In order to defend a territory, to attract a mate, and to survive, birds have developed the ability to mimick and to integrate various and alien sounds to their repertoire of songs. The Bird Choir reflects on how we, humans, like birds, incorporate in our lives other strange sounds to survive, to fit, to be anonymous, to be safe, to protect us and to protect our relatives.
