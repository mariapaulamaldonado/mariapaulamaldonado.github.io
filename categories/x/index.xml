      <title>Elements of Coexistence</title>
      <link>https://mariapaulamaldonado.github.io/blog/16-elementsofcoexistence/</link>

      <description>Facing climate change, environmental destruction, and extinctions as well as individualistic mindsets, inequalities, binary thinking and Eco-anxiety, the project Elements of Coexistence aims to reflect poetically on our shared existence on planet Earth through our shared global commons, such as water, soil, seeds, air, and sunlight.
The project addresses environmental issues by questioning how to dwell in our fragile historical moment while sharing diverse perspectives and points of view.
The first stage of &amp;ldquo;Elements of Coexistence&amp;rdquo;, a project in collaboration with Elham Asadpour, took the shape of an exhibition with the same title at Make-up, in Berlin, Germany, from the 29th of September until the 3rd of October 2022.</description>

      <description>In response to the theme and provocations for the 2022 Project Space Festival, the project &amp;ldquo;Ruderal Practices&amp;rdquo; intended to consider and reflect on our individual, collective and artistic practices through the lens of the Ruderal, inspired by the spontaneous urban ecologies of Berlin.
&amp;ldquo;Ruderal Practices&amp;rdquo; explores how we can inhabit, survive and grow in in-between and precarious environments.
Curatorial Text &amp;ldquo;We take the concept &amp;ldquo;ruderal&amp;quot;° in order to reflect on our individual, spatial and collective practices.</description>

      <description>Anybody anywhere who has a device with internet acces -such as a computer, a tablet or a smartphone- can watch in real time what is happening around Goethe and Schiller&amp;rsquo;s statue in Theaterplatz, Weimar.
There are many Webcams installed in the public space in various cities across Germany. Some of these cameras allow people to access the &amp;ldquo;views&amp;rdquo; that are being captured, but many other cameras do not.
This project questions our permanently surveilled lives, the continuos gathering of data from everyday life, and the power relation between those who observe and those who do not know are the ones being observed.</description>

      <description>Navigating through contours is a project that reflects on how to navigate through the known and the unknown, through that which is near and that which is far. With the help of marks, maps, frames and grids, that create the contours of our own paths and limits of positioning, repositioning, steering and keep going. The project ponders on the representation of places, objects, situations and concepts that we grasp to in order to try to understand them and be able to relate to them.</description>

      <title>BUNKERS: Architecture of fear, architecture of hope</title>
      <link>https://mariapaulamaldonado.github.io/blog/10-bunkers/</link>

      <guid>https://mariapaulamaldonado.github.io/blog/10-bunkers/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;BUNKERS: Architecture of fear, architecture of hope&amp;rdquo; is an artistic research project that reflects on the topic of bunkers -as the ultimate shelters-.
A bunker is an architecture of fear and an architecture of hope. It is a construction -material and conceptual- that offers shelter from various and specific threats. The figure of the bunker, and the categories of fear and hope that are embedded in bunkers, are powerful tools for thinking about living on a damaged planet facing upcoming social and environmental catastrophes, reviewing our collective past, facing our present, and looking towards a possible better future.</description>

      <title>The Bird Choir - Mimicking Is Surviving</title>

      <description>In order to defend a territory, to attract a mate, and to survive, birds have developed the ability to mimick and to integrate various and alien sounds to their repertoire of songs. The Bird Choir reflects on how we, humans, like birds, incorporate in our lives other strange sounds to survive, to fit, to be anonymous, to be safe, to protect us and to protect our relatives.

      <title>I come from…</title>

      <description>When the question &amp;ldquo;Where do you come from?&amp;rdquo; is asked, the first answer is usually related to a country of origin or a nationality. But what can the name of a sovereign state say about a person? Is it possible to get a glimpse of an individual from a country’s name that is attached to the myth of national identity? Is a flag that represents a specific region defined by political borders enough to reflect the complexity and multiplicity of origins that shape a human being?</description>

      <description>The installation is an invitation to contemplate, to lay down, to think, to meditate, to feel, to sleep, to wait, to remember, to rest, to hope, to wonder. Conceived as an antidote to the exponential acceleration and hyperconnectivity that come with the distractions and anxieties of the present moment THE MOON refers to the possibility of downtime from the everyday. In perpetual interplay with its counterpart the sun, nighttime can be a break that brings about a sense of wonder and awe.</description>

      <description>The desperation produced by the impatience of waiting for something to happen, to pass. For the traffic jam to pass, for the taxi to pass, for the rain to pass, for the insecurity to pass, for the hostility to pass. Sometimes there are distractions: a dog, one graffiti, a familiar song, or someone falling. The thought changes and comes back to oneself: what if it is me who falls? Anxiety and uneasiness return.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Feathers were used by many of the indigenous communities in the Americas. They were generally used as body ornaments, garments, capes, headdresses, or were glued to the body to generate body designs. Sometimes they were used to decorate the bodies of the dead, burial bundles or, sometimes, when only the bones remained, they were decorated with feathers and used in ceremonies. Feathers were also used to decorate objects, staffs, masks and statues.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;One of the main uses we have given to paint has been to beautify: we paint the walls of the places we live in and hang painted pictures on them to make them more welcoming, we paint our cars to make them more eye-catching and we even paint objects to innocently hide their nature and raise their status.
Similarly, in beauty salons, procedures involving painting are very common: there are changes of color and shape in the hair, application of pigments on the face to cover imperfections, on the lips and eyes to highlight their expressions and finally the application of layers of nail polish to transform those hard skin surfaces into elements with the potential to communicate moods and personalities.</description>
