      <description>&lt;p&gt;A big table, unmatching cutlery, nettle pesto, foraged mushrooms (eatable and not), uneven chairs, a white tablecloth, and baked polenta. Another table, a typewriter, a bonfire, fingers typing words translated from thoughts (some undesired), paper, a microphone, a loudspeaker, sentences repeated out loud in loops, lights, and chairs. A dinner and an experimental ritual to deal better together with unwanted plants, unwanted thoughts, and unwanted feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mariapaulamaldonado.github.io/blog/15-ruderaldinner/img/15-RuderalDinner1_hu14924426506705050905.jpg&#34;&#xA;    /&gt;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo: Maria Paula Maldonado&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Facing climate change, environmental destruction, and extinctions as well as individualistic mindsets, inequalities, binary thinking and Eco-anxiety, the project Elements of Coexistence aims to reflect poetically on our shared existence on planet Earth through our shared global commons, such as water, soil, seeds, air, and sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The project addresses environmental issues by questioning how to dwell in our fragile historical moment while sharing diverse perspectives and points of view.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first stage of &amp;ldquo;Elements of Coexistence&amp;rdquo;, a project in collaboration with Elham Asadpour, took the shape of an exhibition with the same title at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.make-up.space/&#34;&gt;Make-up&lt;/a&gt;, in Berlin, Germany, from the 29th of September until the 3rd of October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In response to the theme and provocations for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://2022.projectspacefestival-berlin.com/&#34;&gt;2022 Project Space Festival&lt;/a&gt;, the project &amp;ldquo;Ruderal Practices&amp;rdquo; intended to consider and reflect on our individual, collective and artistic practices through the lens of the Ruderal, inspired by the spontaneous urban ecologies of Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ruderal Practices&amp;rdquo; explores how we can inhabit, survive and grow in in-between and precarious environments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;curatorial-text&#34;&gt;Curatorial Text&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We take the concept &amp;ldquo;ruderal&amp;rdquo;° in order to reflect on our individual, spatial and collective practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anybody anywhere who has a device with internet acces -such as a computer, a tablet or a smartphone- can watch in real time what is happening around Goethe and Schiller&amp;rsquo;s statue in Theaterplatz, Weimar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many Webcams installed in the public space in various cities across Germany. Some of these cameras allow people to access the &amp;ldquo;views&amp;rdquo; that are being captured, but many other cameras do not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This project questions our permanently surveilled lives, the continuos gathering of data from everyday life, and the power relation between those who observe and those who do not know are the ones being observed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Navigation durch Umrisse (Navigation through contours)</title>
      <link>https://mariapaulamaldonado.github.io/blog/11-navigation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Navigating through contours is a project that reflects on how to navigate through the known and the unknown, through that which is near and that which is far. With the help of marks, maps, frames and grids, that create the contours of our own paths and limits of positioning, repositioning, steering and keep going. The project ponders on the representation of places, objects, situations and concepts that we grasp to in order to try to understand them and be able to relate to them. It also speculates on the struggles that living beings are facing in order to adapt and survive to new environments, and the transformations that non-living beings are undergoing; as is the case of glaciers that are retreating and plants that are growing on higher and higher terrains in order not to disappear. Both glaciers and plants, as beings that inhabit the world within the framework of their own contours, which in some cases are also threatened.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This collection includes donated and found secondary material such as artworks, documents and images that form a usable resource to contribute to the mediation of the city’s resident FLINTA*-artists, past and present. Due to its ever-changing nature, the library can exist in many forms and spaces, both digital and physical. The aim is to act as a meeting place to collaborate, research and share with others about the collection. This will initiate events such as workshops, exhibitions and performances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>BUNKERS: Architecture of fear, architecture of hope</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;BUNKERS: Architecture of fear, architecture of hope&amp;rdquo; is an artistic research project that reflects on the topic of bunkers -as the ultimate shelters-.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A bunker is an architecture of fear and an architecture of hope. It is a construction -material and conceptual- that offers shelter from various and specific threats. The figure of the bunker, and the categories of fear and hope that are embedded in bunkers, are powerful tools for thinking about living on a damaged planet facing upcoming social and environmental catastrophes, reviewing our collective past, facing our present, and looking towards a possible better future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Bird Choir - Mimicking Is Surviving</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to defend a territory, to attract a mate, and to survive, birds have developed the ability to mimick and to integrate various and alien sounds to their repertoire of songs.&#xA;The Bird Choir reflects on how we, humans, like birds, incorporate in our lives other strange sounds to survive, to fit, to be anonymous, to be safe, to protect us and to protect our relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mariapaulamaldonado.github.io/blog/9-birdchoir/img/9-BirdChoir1-FKB_hu6544723752238309622.jpg&#34;&#xA;    /&gt;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo: Konrad Behr&lt;/em&gt; • Walk of Art.

      <title>I come from…</title>
      <link>https://mariapaulamaldonado.github.io/blog/8-icomefrom/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the question &amp;ldquo;Where do you come from?&amp;rdquo; is asked, the first answer is usually related to a country of origin or a nationality. But what can the name of a sovereign state say about a person? Is it possible to get a glimpse of an individual from a country’s name that is attached to the myth of national identity? Is a flag that represents a specific region defined by political borders enough to reflect the complexity and multiplicity of origins that shape a human being?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Moon</title>
      <link>https://mariapaulamaldonado.github.io/blog/7-themoon/</link>

      <guid>https://mariapaulamaldonado.github.io/blog/7-themoon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The installation is an invitation to contemplate, to lay down, to think, to meditate, to feel, to sleep, to wait, to remember, to rest, to hope, to wonder. Conceived as an antidote to the exponential acceleration and hyperconnectivity that come with the distractions and anxieties of the present moment THE MOON refers to the possibility of downtime from the everyday. In perpetual interplay with its counterpart the sun, nighttime can be a break that brings about a sense of wonder and awe. The artists consider the spatial and temporal disorientation of nighttime as a possibility to explore notions of the profound, the mysterious and the unknown.&lt;/em&gt; ~ Xenia Schürmann&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The desperation produced by the impatience of waiting for something to happen, to pass. For the traffic jam to pass, for the taxi to pass, for the rain to pass, for the insecurity to pass, for the hostility to pass. Sometimes there are distractions: a dog, one graffiti, a familiar song, or someone falling. The thought changes and comes back to oneself: what if it is me who falls? Anxiety and uneasiness return. The traffic jam continues, the taxi doesn&amp;rsquo;t pass, it&amp;rsquo;s still raining, it&amp;rsquo;s still unsafe, and it&amp;rsquo;s still hostile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Plumarias (Featherworks)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Feathers were used by many of the indigenous communities in the Americas. They were generally used as body ornaments, garments, capes, headdresses, or were glued to the body to generate body designs. Sometimes they were used to decorate the bodies of the dead, burial bundles or, sometimes, when only the bones remained, they were decorated with feathers and used in ceremonies. Feathers were also used to decorate objects, staffs, masks and statues. Feathers could be obtained hundreds or thousands of kilometres away from where the feathers were made, and were brought there by exchange between many communities. The effort made to obtain feathers speaks to the importance of feathers in these communities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One of the main uses we have given to paint has been to beautify: we paint the walls of the places we live in and hang painted pictures on them to make them more welcoming, we paint our cars to make them more eye-catching and we even paint objects to innocently hide their nature and raise their status.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in beauty salons, procedures involving painting are very common: there are changes of color and shape in the hair, application of pigments on the face to cover imperfections, on the lips and eyes to highlight their expressions and finally the application of layers of nail polish to transform those hard skin surfaces into elements with the potential to communicate moods and personalities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
